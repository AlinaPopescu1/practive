      /*
TODO
    Data types supported by switch statements include the following:
    *byte and Byte
    *short and Short
    *char and Character
    *int and Integer
    *String
    *enum values

TODO
    This is how it works:
    The switch expression is evaluated once.
	The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
	If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
	When Java reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.
	This will stop the execution of more code and case testing inside the block.
	When a match is found, and the job is done, it's time for a break. There is no need for more testing.
	The default keyword specifies some code to run if there is no case match.

TODO
     *break is used when you want to exit from the loop/switch statement,
     *while return is used to go back to the step where it was called or to stop further execution.


ToDO
      When using SWITCH statement letâ€™s not forget to use break statement
      for each case statement, otherwise it will keep executing code for cases below.
