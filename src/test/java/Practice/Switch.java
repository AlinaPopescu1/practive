TODO
          Data types supported by switch statements include the following:
            *byte and Byte
            *short and Short
            *char and Character
            *int and Integer
            *String
            *enum values

TODO
          This is how it works:
          The switch expression is evaluated once.
          The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
          If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
          When Java reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.
          This will stop the execution of more code and case testing inside the block.
          When a match is found, and the job is done, it's time for a break. There is no need for more testing.
          The default keyword specifies some code to run if there is no case match.

 TODO
          *break is used when you want to exit from the loop/switch statement,
          *while return is used to go back to the step where it was called or to stop further execution.


Todo
           When using SWITCH statement letâ€™s not forget to use break statement
           for each case statement, otherwise it will keep executing code for cases below.
