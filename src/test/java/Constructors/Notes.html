public abstract class PageBase {
public PageBase() {

PageFactory.initElements(Driver.getDriver(), this);

every time we create an object of any child class of PageBase,
the default constructor in child class will call parent class constructor

PageFactory. initElements() static method takes the driver
instance of the given class and the class type,
and returns a Page Object with its fields fully initialized
Parameters:
driver - The driver that will be used to look up the elements
this   - returns the page object with @FindBy locators.

this--> will refer/return a different page object, once the child class constructor
calls the super class constructor, which eventually will run before child class constructor.

an abstract class is still a super class, so its constructors run
when someone makes an instance of a concrete subclass.

Page Factory will initialize every WebElement variable with a reference to a
corresponding element on the actual web page based on “locators” defined.
This is done by using @FindBy annotations.*/
